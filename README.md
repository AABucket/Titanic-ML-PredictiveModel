# Titanic-ML-PredictiveModel
This repository will store my project which predicts the death of people on the Titanic using the Titanic Dataset from Kaggle.

# Starting the Predictive Model
I have added the Data Analyses python file. This file runs some analysis and draws graphs to show which columns should be used for the predictive models.


# Data Analysis
To start off I had to look at the actual training dataset to get a feel of what type of data I would be working with.

#### This shows the First 5 Rows of the Dataset:

## Analysis on Gender/Age:

To start off analysing this dataset I needed to decide what variables I would like to look at first. 
The __First__ set of varibales I looked at were: Age and Sex
I used the data to create two histograms, one for **Male** and one for **Female**.
They both show Survival rate with the **Age** on the x-Axis.

Looking at the histograms we can see that:
 * More female passengers survived than male
 * Lower survival rate for male passengers between the age of 15-30 
 * Higher survival rate for female passengers between the ages of 15-40
