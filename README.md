# Titanic-ML-PredictiveModel
This repository will store my project which predicts the death of people on the Titanic using the Titanic Dataset from Kaggle.

# Kaggle

# Starting the Predictive Model
I have added the Data Analyses python file. This file runs some analysis and draws graphs to show which columns should be used for the predictive models.


# Data Analysis
To start off I had to look at the actual training dataset to get a feel of what type of data I would be working with.
